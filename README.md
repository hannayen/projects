## ORIE 3120 Paper - COVID-19 Vaccinations
Group project that used Jupyter Notebook (Python) and Tableau to analyze global COVID-19 data with the goal of answering the following three questions:

* What characteristics of a country (GDP, life expectancy, human development index, median age, etc.) best predict the vaccine distribution rate?
* How quickly are different vaccines (ex. Moderna, Pfizer, etc.) being used? Is there a relationship between the type of vaccine used in a country and the location/characteristics of the country?
* For which contact rates and recovery rates is vaccination the most effective or critical?

Initial data visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, line graphs, bar graphs, qq-plots, autocorrelation plots, and scatterplots were created. The data analysis methods performed were linear regression, logistic regression, and simulation with SIR modeling.

## INFO 2950 Project - MLB Salaries
Group project that uses Jupyter Notebook (Python) to analyze MLB data with the goal of answering the following questions:

* In the MLB, are a player's batting statistics indicative of their salary? Which statistics are the most relevant?
* Has the importance of having good batting statistics increased over time? Is there a relationship to salary?
* Can we predict how much a player will make the following season based on their previous batting history?
* Can we determine which current players are the most overpaid for their batting production and which players are the most underpaid?

The appendix contains the initial data cleaning of the baseball and salary datasets so that there is one final dataframe that can be referenced. Phase V contains the initial exploratory data analysis (observing potential relationships using summary statistics, scatterplots), the data analysis plan of action and implementation (linear regression, logistic regression), analysis of the results (AIC scores, classification report), and the final results and conclusions based on the data analysis.
